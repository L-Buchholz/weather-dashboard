# Weather-Dashboard

## Bootcamp homework #6

A traveler requires an interactive weather map that allows them to view the current conditions and forecast for multiple cities, so that they can plan accordingly for their trip. The following "Acceptance Criteria" for this feature were requested and have now been implemented:

- A weather dashboard with form inputs has been created and connects to the OpenWeather API.
- When a user searches for a city in the form, they are presented with current and future weather conditions for that city.
- Current conditions include the following:
  - City name
  - Current date
  - An icon representing weather conditions
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - Wind speed
  - A UV index, including a color indicating whether conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
- Future conditions -- a 5-day forecast -- include the following:
  - The date
  - An icon representing weather conditions
  - Temperature
  - Wind speed
  - Humidity
- All form entries (city searches) are saved to localStorage and as persistent search buttons, which will provide weather updates for their respective cities when clicked.

Additionally, there are no errors in the console when it is inspected using Chrome DevTools and the Javascript includes comments.
